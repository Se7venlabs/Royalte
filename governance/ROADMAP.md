# Royaltē Platform Roadmap

**Status:** single source of truth for platform progress.
**Authority:** subordinate to `constitution/ROYALTE_MASTER_CONSTITUTION.md`.
**Updated:** after every Board-approved merge (per governance rule, see `AGENT_MEMORY.md` § 9).

When this roadmap and the Constitution disagree, **the Constitution wins.**

## ROYALTĒ v3.0 — Board Launch Master Plan

| Section | Item | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Section 1 | Engine Provider Registry™ | ☑ Complete — PR #356, commit `c141c0b`, 2026-07-17 |
| Section 3 | Connect Library | ⏳ Next Board Initiative — not yet briefed |

**Section 1 summary:** `provider-acquisition/registry/EngineProviderRegistry.js` — governance-level, static, 15-provider catalog (12 PAL-migrated and Board-certified, 3 legacy/not-yet-migrated), separate from and non-duplicative of the runtime `ProviderRegistry.js`. Full detail: `governance/ENGINE_PROVIDER_REGISTRY_COMPLETION_REPORT.md`, `governance/ENGINE_PROVIDER_REGISTRY_ARCHITECTURE.md`.

**Open Board work items from Section 1's findings** (deferred, not yet authorized for implementation):
- PAL migration of SoundCloud, Wikidata, and Listen Notes (all three currently called directly from `run-scan.js`/`listen-notes.js`, predating the PAL architecture — no connector, no certification suite)
- Removal of SoundCloud's hardcoded `client_id` literal (`api/_lib/run-scan.js:1429`) in favor of an environment variable

*(Section 2 was not referenced in the Section 1 or Section 3 briefs received to date — status unknown, not assumed complete or pending.)*

## Active Build — OS Migration Sprint

The constitutional architecture is complete. The platform is now in its migration epoch:
eliminating legacy provider acquisition one provider at a time using the proven blueprint
from Apple Production Migration (PR #189, 2026-07-02).

**Migration order** (Board authorizes each): Apple ✅ → Spotify (recommended next) → MusicBrainz / Deezer / YouTube / others.

**Note:** this roadmap's phase inventory between Sprint 9 (Mission Control Data API™, above) and Phase 5.2 (this entry) is known to be incomplete — several later phases from this build cycle (Sprint 10 ATHENA™ Intelligence Engine, Sprint 11 Executive Brief™ Engine, Sprint 12 MC Integration Layer, the P0 MC payload bridge fix, and the PAL Connector Modernization Program covering ACRCloud ×2/Discogs/MusicBrainz/YouTube/Deezer/MLC/Spotify/TIDAL/TheAudioDB) are not yet reflected in the tables above. Backfilling that gap is a separate governance task, out of scope for this entry.

## What's Live in `main` Today

- **Territory Intelligence Engine™ is now the platform's sole territory-classification authority — no known live exceptions remain** (Phase 5.4, PR #354, 2026-07-17): resolves the three findings Phase 5.3's platform-wide audit surfaced. `public/js/dashboard.js`'s Global Presence card reads `globalMusicFootprint.distributionGaps.territories` (previously read a deprecated field hardcoded `null`, so it always rendered unstyled regardless of real data). `lib/rie/EvidenceBridge.js`'s `translateTerritories()` calls the Engine directly instead of independently re-classifying the same evidence (`storefrontIsAvailable()` removed). `api/_lib/persist-os-scan.js`'s `extractTerritories()` gained an Engine-sourced fallback, restoring real `territory_gain`/`territory_loss` monitoring alerts that had been dormant since an unrelated field was nulled during the Health Engine migration. All fixes additive; every existing fallback shape and payload contract preserved unchanged; runtime-verified against the actual production code, not static analysis alone.
- **Distribution Gaps™ on the Global Music Footprint™ workspace** (Phase 5.2-DG, PR #351, 2026-07-17): new section beneath the world map — summary panel (Total Requiring Attention / Unavailable / Unknown / Pending Review) + a responsive full-list panel (desktop right drawer with the map still visible, tablet wide drawer, mobile full-height bottom sheet with drag-handle affordance) with search, status/provider filter chips, and a territory detail sub-panel. `api/_lib/global-music-footprint.js`'s `buildDistributionGaps()` derives every field (status, providers, reason, recommended action, last verified) directly from the Territory Intelligence Engine™'s real per-territory evidence — additive `distributionGaps` field, all existing GMF output fields unchanged. Established as the binding responsive-first standard (desktop/tablet/mobile as equal citizens, not a post-build optimization) for all future Royaltē workspace/panel/engine UI work, per the same Board directive.
- **Territory Intelligence Engine™ is the sole authoritative source of territory/availability intelligence** (Phase 5.2, PR #349, tag `territory-intelligence-engine-v1.0`, 2026-07-17): `api/_lib/territory-intelligence.js` — `assembleTerritoryIntelligence(evidencePackages)`, Board-ratified five-state model (`AVAILABLE`/`UNAVAILABLE`/`UNKNOWN`/`NOT_EVALUATED`/`ERROR`), provider-general reconciliation policy, Apple-sourced via PAL in this phase. One canonical territory vocabulary at `lib/territory/canonical-territory-vocabulary.js` replaces three prior fragmented copies. Global Music Footprint™ (`api/_lib/global-music-footprint.js`) converted to a consumer of the Engine's output; public output shape unchanged. `api/territory-scan.js` repaired and rewired onto the Engine (two explicitly-versioned contract changes, `dataSourceVersion` field). Legacy Apple storefront duplication (`getAppleMusic()`, `checkGlobalStorefrontAvailability()`) removed after confirmation it was already dead code, not live duplication.

- **Phases 1–8 are merged and locked.** The full Intelligence Stack is wired into production:
  - **Rule Library** at `api/rules/` — declarative pure-data rules with `(cio) => boolean` conditions; polarity-aware; category-indexed
  - **Intelligence Engine** at `api/_lib/intelligence-engine.js` — `runIntelligenceEngine(cio, ruleLibrary)` sole entrypoint; generic iteration; deeply frozen output
  - **Golden Fixture Library** at `tests/fixtures/` — 7 canonical CIO reference states; 30-assertion regression surface; append-only
  - **Canonical Catalog Model™ Composer** at `api/_lib/catalog-model-composer.js` — sole owner of `catalogModel` assembly; pure composition; never evaluates rules
  - **Catalog Rule Migration Layer** in `api/rules/catalog-rules.js` — Phase 6D dual-read layer connecting the Rule Library to the Canonical Catalog Model™
  - **Royaltē Health Engine™** at `api/_lib/health-engine.js` — `computeHealthScore(intelligenceReport)` sole scoring authority; Board-locked weights and grade thresholds; pure, deterministic, deeply frozen output
  - **Royaltē Executive Brief Engine™** at `api/_lib/executive-brief-engine.js` — `generateExecutiveBrief(cio, intelligenceReport, healthReport, canonicalHealth)` sole entrypoint; presentation layer only; never scores, never invents
  - **Se7ven Labs IP Vault™** at `/ip/` — permanent internal corporate IP register (24 markdown files); survives product lifecycles, mergers, acquisitions
- **Provider Expansion Sprint + Deezer complete** (PRs #194–#201, 2026-07-02/03):
  - **Seven constitutional providers** — Apple Music (100), Spotify (90), MusicBrainz (80), Discogs (75), YouTube OAC (85), The MLC (95), Deezer (80)
  - **Streaming Verification Authority™** — Deezer; independent evidence foundation for future Verification Intelligence™; `getDeezer()` direct-call retired
  - **Recording Intelligence Foundation™** — Board-locked RECORDING_CONFIDENCE_WEIGHTS (ISRC 40 / MB 30 / Apple 20 / Spotify 10)
  - **Board Certification Harness™** now at **740 assertions / 11 suites** — permanent gate for all future provider phases
  - **Constitutional Publishing Authority** — The MLC; Recording → Song Code → Musical Work hierarchy preserved; foundation for future Publishing / Rights / Revenue Intelligence
  - **All original streaming providers (Apple, Spotify, Deezer) now 100% migrated to PAL**
  - **Correction (Platform Recovery Phase 1, 2026-07-20):** the bullet above is a historical record, accurate as of PRs #194–#201 (2026-07-02/03), and is preserved unedited. It is now out of date as a description of the platform's current state: as of 2026-07-20, all 10 providers are PAL-acquired in `api/_lib/run-scan.js` — Apple, Spotify, MusicBrainz, Discogs, YouTube, The MLC, Deezer, AudioDB, Last.fm, and Tidal (confirmed via `governance/NORMALIZATION_LAYER_PLATFORM_CERTIFICATION.md`). Acquisition-layer migration is not the same as canonical merge-authority — see `governance/PHASE_1_EVIDENCEBRIDGE_ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW.md` for which providers are merge-authoritative today (Apple, Spotify only).
- **Royaltē OS v1.0 is the certified production baseline** (Phase 3.5, PR #192, tag `royalte-os-v1.0` at `65c5c16`, 2026-07-02):
  - **Board Certification Harness™** at `tests/certification/harness.mjs` — 10 suites, 673 assertions, exit 0 = CERTIFIED; permanent certification gate
  - **Certification Artist Library** at `tests/certification/artist-library/` — 12 archetypes covering full range of real-world edge cases; append-only
  - **Determinism certified:** same evidence always produces the same CIM (verified 10 runs IE + 5 runs full RIE with fixed clock)
  - **Performance baseline:** Full RIE pipeline p95 = 0.33ms (budget 500ms); Intelligence Engine p95 = 0.09ms
  - **`deepFreeze` bug fixed** in `api/_lib/backend-intelligence.js` — arrays now properly frozen in the CIM
  - **Certification gates locked:** IE, Health Engine, Rule Library, RIE changes require 100% harness pass before merge; release tags require harness + CI green
- **Phase 8 scan pipeline wiring** (`api/audit.js`): every scan now runs the full constitutional pipeline end-to-end:
  - `runIntelligenceEngine(cio, ALL_RULES)` → `computeHealthScore(report)` [once] → `generateHealthReport(cio, report)` → `generateExecutiveBrief(cio, report, healthReport, healthScore)` → persists `healthScore`, `healthReport`, `executiveBrief` in the enriched scan payload
  - `computeHealthScore()` called exactly once per scan; canonical result passed downstream, never re-derived
- **Royaltē Scan Experience V1 is DESIGN FROZEN.** PR #122 remains open and is held until intelligence wiring is complete. No layout / spacing / typography / color / animation / UX changes are authorised in the meantime.
- **Constitution at v1.3** (effective 2026-06-11) ratifies the seven-layer Engineering Stack.
- **Phase 5 rule format** permits the optional `polarity: 'positive'` field on positive-framing rules — applied to `publishing.strong-coverage` and `catalog.complete-delivery-verified`.
- **Mission Control™ Health Intelligence™ card redesigned** (PR #211, 2026-07-03): 6-section executive assessment fully wired to Health Engine output. `applyHealthIntelligencePlan` is the sole DOM writer; `buildHealthIntelligencePlan` is the sole plan builder. All values sourced constitutionally. Executive Layout Optimization™ v1.0 reduces desktop page height ~260px; final holistic pass deferred until all MC modules complete.
- **Mission Control™ Identity Intelligence™ card redesigned** (PR #213, 2026-07-03): 6-section executive passport replaces the fingerprint ring + provider checklist. Sections: Identity Coverage (% + grade), Identity Summary (4 counts), Identity Providers (constitutional + platform pills), Biggest Risk, Biggest Win, Recent Changes. `applyIdentityIntelligencePlan` is the sole DOM writer; `buildIdentityIntelligencePlan` is the sole plan builder. Deezer/TIDAL read from `payload.platforms.*` via Evidence Bridge™.
- **Mission Control™ Publishing Intelligence™ card redesigned** (PR #215, 2026-07-03): 7-section executive passport replaces the ring + flat checklist. Sections: Publishing Coverage (% + grade), Publishing Summary (4 counts), Publishing Systems (6 metric rows), Financial Impact™ (NEW — risk badge + Potential Royalty Impact™ + Estimated Resolution), Biggest Risk, Biggest Win, Recent Changes. Financial Neutrality Rule™ preserved. `applyPublishingIntelligencePlan` is the sole DOM writer; `buildPublishingIntelligencePlan` is the sole plan builder.

---

## What's Not Live Yet

- **Publishing Intelligence™ not yet built.** The MLC evidence (recordings + works) is acquired and preserved in the CIM. The intelligence layer that reads this evidence — Publishing Intelligence™, Rights Intelligence™, Revenue Intelligence™ — requires a separate Board brief.
- **Health Trend sparkline (Section 5) shows current scan only.** Historical Health Snapshots™ wiring is deferred; positions 0–3 display "—" until a historical scan series exists.
- **Monitoring and Revenue reserved sections remain placeholders.** `MONITORING`, `REVENUE`, and `GENERAL` in the Rule Library carry empty arrays; `monitoring` and `revenue` in reserved sections ship `null`. Phase 9+ may begin populating them.
- **All future work is Board-authorized only.** No phase begins until the Board issues a formal brief.

---

## Next Engineering Target

**Superseded by later Board activity not yet backfilled into this section** (see the Territory Intelligence Sprint note above) — several of the items below were completed in phases this roadmap doesn't yet reflect. Left as-is rather than guessed at; reconciling this section is part of the same backfill task noted above.

**Phase 5.2 (Territory Intelligence Engine™) is complete as of 2026-07-17.** The Board's stated candidate next initiatives, none yet formally briefed:
- Royaltē Platform Architecture v1.0 — document the complete platform architecture
- Connector completion roadmap — finish remaining Connectors™
- Engine completion roadmap — finish remaining Intelligence Engines™
- ATHENA™ activation, once the underlying intelligence platform is sufficiently mature

No sprint begins until the Board issues a formal brief.

Prior options (carried forward from an earlier roadmap state, status not reconciled):
- **Publishing Intelligence™** — consume MLC + publishing evidence from CIM to generate constitutional publishing insight; requires Board brief
- **Rights Intelligence™** — consume publisher/writer/ISWC evidence to generate ownership insight; requires Board brief
- **UI Wiring** — surface Phase 8 engine output (`healthScore`, `healthReport`, `executiveBrief`) in Mission Control and the scan UI; requires Board brief
- **Phase 3.5 Sprint A** — dead code retirement (V1 stubs); deferred from Phase 3.5; requires Board authorization
- **Phase 3.5 Sprint E** — ISRC Coverage real-data validation against live tracks
- **Phase 3.5 Sprint F** — Publishing expansion (ASCAP/BMI/SOCAN adapter)

No sprint begins until the Board issues a formal brief.

## How to Update This Roadmap

Per the constitutional governance rule (see `AGENT_MEMORY.md` § 9), every Board-approved merge that affects platform state shall:

1. Tick the relevant ⬜ entry to ✅ in the **Phase Status** table.
2. Append the corresponding lock point (commit SHA, tag if any) in the row.
3. Update **What's Live in `main` Today** if the merge changes platform behaviour or new files are added to the Engineering Stack.
4. Move the **Next Engineering Target** entry into the Phase Status table once a Board brief is issued and work commences.

This roadmap is a **living document**. Older state is preserved through `governance/CHANGELOG.md` (append-only) and `governance/BOARD_DECISIONS.md` (append-only); the roadmap itself reflects only the present.
