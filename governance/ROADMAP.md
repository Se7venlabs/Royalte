# Royaltē Platform Roadmap

**Status:** single source of truth for platform progress.
**Authority:** subordinate to `constitution/ROYALTE_MASTER_CONSTITUTION.md`.
**Updated:** after every Board-approved merge (per governance rule, see `AGENT_MEMORY.md` § 9).

When this roadmap and the Constitution disagree, **the Constitution wins.**

## What's Live in `main` Today

- **Phases 1–7 + 7.5 are merged and locked.** The full Engineering Stack (Section 8B of the Constitution) is in place at the file paths documented in `docs/ROYALTE_ENGINEERING_STACK.md`. The Golden Fixture Library™ at `tests/fixtures/` provides 7 canonical CIO reference states + a 30-assertion regression surface. The Health Engine™ at `api/_lib/health-engine.js` projects Intelligence Reports into a 0-100 score + A+/A/B/C/D/F grade with Board-locked category weights. The **Se7ven Labs Intellectual Property Vault™** at `/ip/` is the authoritative internal corporate record of all Se7ven Labs LLC IP, ratified as permanent across every product lifecycle, subsidiary, merger, or restructuring.
- **Royaltē Scan Experience V1 is DESIGN FROZEN.** PR #122 remains open and is held until intelligence wiring is complete. No layout / spacing / typography / color / animation / UX changes are authorised in the meantime.
- **Constitution at v1.3** (effective 2026-06-11) ratifies the seven-layer Engineering Stack.
- **Phase 5 rule format now permits** the optional `polarity: 'positive'` field on positive-framing rules — applied to `publishing.strong-coverage` and `catalog.complete-delivery-verified`.

## What's Not Live Yet

- **The Intelligence Engine is not yet wired into the scan pipeline.** `runIntelligenceEngine(cio, ALL_RULES)` exists and tests green, but `api/audit.js` does not yet call it. That's Phase 7.
- **No UI consumer reads engine output.** Phase 7+ will introduce the first consumers under the Constitutional separation rule.
- **Phase 5 reserved categories** (`MONITORING`, `REVENUE`, `GENERAL` in the Rule Library) carry empty arrays; **Phase 4 reserved CIO sections** (`monitoring`, `revenue`) ship `{ reserved: true }` placeholders. Phase 7+ may begin populating them.

## Anticipated Phase 7 — Engine Wiring (no brief authorised)

When the Board authorises Phase 7, the expected scope is:
- Wire `assembleCio` into `api/audit.js` so every scan persists a CIO alongside the canonical AuditResponse
- Wire `runIntelligenceEngine(cio, ALL_RULES)` so every scan produces an engine output
- Persistence path TBD (Supabase column on `audit_scans` is the leading candidate)
- **Zero UI changes** — `public/index.html` stays DESIGN FROZEN

The Board has not yet issued the Phase 7 brief. No work has commenced.

## Outside the Intelligence-Wiring Sprint

These tracks were active prior to the sprint and remain on the roadmap:

| Track | Status |
|---|---|
| Royaltē Scan Experience V1 (`public/index.html`) | 🔒 DESIGN FROZEN (PR #122 held) |
| Royaltē Master Constitution | ✅ v1.3 (2026-06-11) |
| Canonical Payload V2 (wire format) | ✅ Board-ratified (`constitution/CANONICAL_PAYLOAD_V2.md`) |
| Beta launch | June 1, 2026 (per `LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md`) |
| Live intelligence sources to wire | Spotify · Apple Music · MusicBrainz · Discogs · Listen Notes · YouTube · MLC Public API · MLC Bulk Data Feed |

## How to Update This Roadmap

Per the new constitutional rule (see `AGENT_MEMORY.md` § 9), every Board-approved merge that affects platform state shall:

1. Tick the relevant ⬜ entry to ✅ in the **Phase Status** table.
2. Append the corresponding lock point (commit SHA, tag if any) in the row.
3. Update **What's Live in `main` Today** if the merge changes platform behaviour or new files are added to the Engineering Stack.
4. Move stale items out of **Anticipated Phase N** into a new section if a Phase is restructured.

This roadmap is a **living document**. Older state is preserved through `governance/CHANGELOG.md` (append-only) and `governance/BOARD_DECISIONS.md` (append-only); the roadmap itself reflects only the present.
