# Distribution Gaps™ — Global Music Footprint™ — Completion Report

**Status:** ✅ MERGED — Board-approved 2026-07-17. Merge commit `930fd91` on `main` (fast-forward via PR #351). Branch `feat/distribution-gaps-gmf` deleted post-merge.
**Governing document:** Board Directive 2026-07-17, "Global Music Footprint™ — Distribution Gaps™ — Responsive-First Implementation + Mandatory PR Preview"
**Board decision record:** `governance/BOARD_DECISIONS.md`, entry dated 2026-07-17

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Distribution Gaps™ is a new section on the Global Music Footprint™ workspace, directly beneath the world map, surfacing every territory not confirmed `AVAILABLE` — with real per-territory evidence (status, contributing providers, reason, recommended action, last-verified timestamp) sourced exclusively from the Territory Intelligence Engine™. Built responsive-first per the Board's explicit directive: desktop right-side drawer, tablet wide drawer, mobile full-height bottom sheet — not a squeezed-down desktop component at any tier.

**Data integrity, as mandated:** every field is a deterministic derivation from the Engine's own `evidence[]` array (provider, reasonCode, acquiredAt). Nothing is fabricated — a territory with no evidence shows empty providers and a null `lastVerified`, never invented data. This is enforced both structurally (the derivation function has no code path that invents a value) and by certification (Suite 20, Group D, "No fabrication," 12 dedicated assertions).

## 2. File-by-File Summary

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `api/_lib/global-music-footprint.js` | Added `buildDistributionGaps(territoryIntelligence)` — pure derivation producing `{totalRequiringAttention, unavailable, unknown, notEvaluated, territories[]}`. Wired as a new `distributionGaps` field on `assembleGlobalMusicFootprint()`'s existing return object (additive; all v1.0 fields unchanged). `null` on the legacy fallback and error paths — no per-territory evidence exists there to derive it from honestly. |
| `public/workspaces/global-music-footprint.html` | New `<section class="gf-gaps-section">` inserted directly beneath the map/legend, before "Additional Territories." New drawer + territory-detail markup added as fixed-position overlays (same pattern as the existing `#ws-no-scan-overlay`). Dev-fixture gate broadened from `isLocal`-only to `isLocal \|\| ?dev=1` (Board requirement: the preview must self-seed, no DevTools/sessionStorage pasting). Fixture data extended with a 24-territory sample spanning all states and multiple providers. |
| `public/css/gmf-distribution-gaps.css` *(new)* | All Distribution Gaps styling: summary cards, drawer/scrim, filter chips, territory rows, detail sub-panel, and the full responsive override set (tablet §6, mobile §6) — including the mobile full-sheet transform, drag-handle affordance, and 44px minimum touch targets. |
| `public/js/gmf-distribution-gaps.js` *(new)* | Pure renderer. Reads `royalte_workspace_context.globalMusicFootprint.distributionGaps` via the existing Workspace Contract (`RoyalteContext.readWorkspaceContext`); if absent, shows an honest empty state rather than fabricating data. Implements: summary render, drawer/sheet open-close (with scrim, Escape key, focus return), search, status + provider filter chips, territory list render, and the territory detail sub-panel. |
| `tests/certification/suites/20-distribution-gaps.mjs` *(new)* | 37 assertions across 7 groups (A–G): presence/null-on-fallback, count integrity (traces to `territoryIntelligence.summary` exactly), full territory list (not just gaps — required for the "Available" filter), no-fabrication (12 assertions), determinism, status vocabulary (exactly the Board's 4-tier list), purity. |
| `tests/certification/harness.mjs` | Suite 20 registered. |

## 3. Certification Results

**Suite 20 — Distribution Gaps™: 37/37 assertions, 0 failed.**
**Full certification harness (suites 01–20): 1587/1587 assertions, 0 failed. BOARD VERDICT: CERTIFIED.**

## 4. Regression Results

| Suite | Assertions | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Certification harness (01–20) | 1587 | ✅ 0 failed |
| `node tests/pipeline-test.mjs` | 226 | ✅ 0 failed |
| `node tests/territory-scan-test.mjs` | 31 | ✅ 0 failed |
| `node tests/registry-test.mjs` | 168 | ✅ 0 failed |
| `node tests/evidence-contracts-test.mjs` | 203 | ✅ 0 failed |
| `node tests/evidence-registry-test.mjs` | 66 | ✅ 0 failed |

**Total: 2,281 assertions, zero failures.** No existing GMF consumer (Mission Control's compact card, Health Intelligence's footprint score) is affected — `distributionGaps` is a new field, not a change to any existing field.

## 5. Visual Verification

Performed directly this session (Chrome extension connected mid-session; noted to the Board at the time). Method: static files served locally (`python3 -m http.server`, approved by the Board before use), the real production HTML/CSS/JS with no mocking beyond the dev fixture — same rendering path as the Vercel Preview. Verified at each tier:

- **Desktop (1440×900, confirmed 1440×723 achieved — browser chrome consumes vertical space, width exact):** world map remains fully visible with the drawer open; summary cards aligned in a 4-column row; no horizontal scroll.
- **Tablet (768×1024, confirmed 768×847 achieved):** summary reflows to 2×2; drawer widens to `min(560px, 78vw)`, comfortable touch spacing; no nav overlap.
- **Mobile (390×844 requested; the browser tool's `resize_window` floored at 500×667 — still self-identified and rendered as "Executive Mobile™," the same ≤640px tier, so the breakpoint behavior verified is correct even though the exact pixel target wasn't reachable through this tool):** summary cards stack one-per-row; drawer becomes a full-height bottom sheet with a drag-handle affordance and an unambiguous close button; territory rows collapse to cards with the reason line visible inline; the territory detail view opens as its own full-screen sheet with an obvious Back and Close.
- **Console:** zero errors or exceptions at any tier (checked via `read_console_messages`, `onlyErrors: true`, after every major interaction).
- **Interactions verified live:** View Full List open, status filter (All → Unavailable, correctly narrowed to exactly 6 rows), row click → territory detail (Brazil: Unavailable / Apple Music / "Catalog not found in this storefront" / recommended action / Jul 17 2026), Back navigation, Close, and the mobile full-screen detail sheet (United States: Available / Apple Music + Spotify / "Catalog confirmed in this storefront" / "No action needed" / Jul 17 2026).

**One fix made during verification:** mobile filter chips were 40px min-height; corrected to 44px to strictly satisfy "minimum 44px touch targets throughout" — caught by direct measurement against the Board's own stated number, not assumed compliant.

**Confirmation:** all three responsive layouts have been manually verified in a live browser (not inferred from code review), and no console errors occur at any of the three viewport tiers.

## 6. Git Summary

- **Branch:** `feat/distribution-gaps-gmf`
- **Base:** `main` at `29222f1` (post Phase 5.2 governance backfill)
- **PR:** [#351](https://github.com/Se7venlabs/Royalte/pull/351)
- **Commit SHA:** `3600e29`
- **CI status:** ✅ green — `Run pipeline test` pass, `Vercel` deployment pass, `Vercel Preview Comments` pass

## 7. Developer Preview

**URL:** `https://royalte-a48t0mjge-darrylwest-7086s-projects.vercel.app/workspaces/global-music-footprint.html?dev=1` — confirmed deployed from commit `3600e29` (this PR's current head).

Locally tested this session at `http://localhost:8934/workspaces/global-music-footprint.html?dev=1` (static file server, same HTML/CSS/JS the Preview serves).

**No steps required beyond opening the URL.** The dev-fixture gate now activates on `?dev=1` regardless of hostname (previously localhost-only); the fixture ("Black Alternative," 24 sample territories spanning Available/Unavailable/Unknown/Pending Review with multiple providers) loads automatically. No DevTools, no sessionStorage pasting, no login/session required — confirmed directly this session.

**Mission Control entry point** (if preferred over the direct workspace URL): `/mission-control.html?vault=1&dev=1` → click the Global Music Footprint™ node.

## 8. Merge Readiness

**Not merged. Awaiting Board visual sign-off on the PR Preview**, per the Board's explicit closing instruction: "Wait for Board approval before any merge" — reaffirmed after the prior Phase 5.2 review cycle. Certification and regression are both green; the one open item is the Board's own look at the rendered PR Preview (this report documents what was already verified directly in a live browser this session, but the Board asked for its own review of the actual PR Preview specifically, not a substitute for it).
